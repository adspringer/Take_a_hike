                    <p>The San Diego Hiking Club was founded in 1980 by the
                    late Skip Ruland for the purpose of acquainting people with
                    the wilderness areas of San Diego County. When The
                    Wilderness Association of San Diego, Inc. was established in
                    1986, it began sponsorship of the Club. The Association was
                    created by a group of people whose common bond was a strong
                    interest in the preservation of San Diego County's
                    wilderness and the desire to experience the beauty of our
                    mountains, deserts, beaches, and to foster a sense of wonder and respect for our
                    natural surroundings. </p></a>

                    There are different levels, but we all share one common:
                    using our legs to move up down hills. Most of the time on
                    dirt trails, but there are different terrains: rockies or
                    gravels or in water, river or mud; different settings:
                    mountain, forest, wilderness or desert. </p></a>
